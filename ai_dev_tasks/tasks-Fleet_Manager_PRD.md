### Notes

- The existing fleet manager scene has basic structure but needs significant enhancement to match PRD requirements
- Player data structure already has fleet array but needs mission assignment per ship
- Current fleet manager uses hardcoded activeShipId in FleetManager class - needs integration with player data
- Space scene already has state persistence methods that can be leveraged for multi-ship state management
